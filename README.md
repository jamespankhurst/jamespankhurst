### welcome ðŸ‘‹

I've always been a 'solo' coder, not out of choice, but being self taught never 'fitted-in', didn't adhere to the coding 'standards'.

Git enables me to display my coding, and more importantly learn the standards that are required.

Whilst I can code, I am useless at graphic/artistic design. 

Hopefully we can team up!
