I've been coding for 40 years.

The one thing I have learnt, is that whilst I can make stuff work, I am *useless* at making stuff look good.

Before the internet it didn't really matter as the user got what they were given. Then..

I realised that it's working with *creative, artistic* people that makes the difference;

It's working with *creative, artistic* people that makes the difference, some of my examples;

www.trackpro.co.uk (2007 - Insurance Claim tracking system), 
www.thersp.com (2002 - Now Viviene Clore - Artisite Content Management System), 
www.sharonleeltd.co.uk (2001 - Cap design  system)

Perhaps because of this, I never really got the chance to study Javascript, CSS etc.

Unexpectedly, (don't ask) I had some time and I decided to recity that.

Harking back to my 80's Commodore 64 coding days, I decided to make a game as a learning vehicle, *Orion Dice Decide*.

I got so far, but when I realised and understood that js objects could contain arrays and other js objects, it was *Game Over*. 

I abandoned the project and returned to my main project letcomm.

I have been studying javascript. The power of js objects is remarkable.

See my javascript *apprentice piece* Orion Dice Decide, forever unfinished..
