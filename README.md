### Greetings ðŸ‘‹

Been coding for years, the one thing I have learnt, is that whilst I can make stuff work, I am *useless* at making stuff look good.

It's working with *creative, artistic* people that makes the difference, some of my examples;

www.trackpro.co.uk (2007 - Insurance Claim tracking system), 
www.thersp.com (2002 - Now Viviene Clore - Artisite Content Management System), 
www.sharonleeltd.co.uk (2001 - Cap design  system)

My skills and experience are mainly back end; .NET, SQLServer etc.

I have been studying javascript. The power of js objects is remarkable.

See my javascript *apprentice piece* Orion Dice Decide, forever unfinished..
