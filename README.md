### If only... 

.. I'd explored Git earlier.

Been coding for years and had been meaning to look into Git for years. 

Finally got un-lazy in September 2021.   

What a fantastic resource. 

My internet coding background is mainly backend. I realised that whilst I could make stuff work, I was *useless* at making stuff look good. 
So I started working with designers and realised that it's working with *creative, artistic* people that makes the difference.
Some examples working with *Storm Design* in early 2000's;

I developed an online database application Claimtrack.co.uk, classic ASP, for the insurance repair/refurbishment industry.

I then re-coded for .NET and Claimtrack became;

This was a great tool for landlords, but was of no use to tenants.

In the current and future generations, for many, home ownership hss become a *hope*, rather than an *expectation*.

Yet the landlords and property management companies hold all the cards.

So I've decided to re-write my code once again, this time for the tenant...

Recent events gave me time to study Javascript. 

Obviously I have been using js for years, but as a back end coder, really just passed data for the designers.

Harking back to my Commodore 64 coding days, I decided to make a game.
