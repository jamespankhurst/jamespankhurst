### Greetings ðŸ‘‹

I've been coding for 40 years, can't remember how many languages I've forgotton.

So if any young coders come across some annoying legacy code to navigate (dBase, dataEase, MS Access, vbScript, Classis Asp etc) please feel free to drop me a line, maybe I can help. Have successfully converted a couple of sites from classic asp to .NET.

The one thing I have learnt, is that whilst I can make stuff work, I am *useless* at making stuff look good.

It's working with *creative, artistic* people that makes the difference, some examples;

www.trackpro.co.uk (2007 - Insurance Claim tracking system)
www.thersp.com (2002 - Now Viviene Clore - Artisite Contnet Management System)
www.sharonleeltd.co.uk (2001 - Cap design  system)

My skills are all back end; .NET, SQLServer etc, not getting involved with the html, ccss, javascipt.

I decided to recity that, the results, so far, you can see at my *apprentice* javascript piece; Orion Dice Decide.

or the pinned tab below.

Note on my avatar: I was experimenting with js background animation. I was making a scene where the middle star explodes. This consisted of several panels, which I created individually. When I put them together.....
