### I'm a Git newbie ðŸ‘‹

I've always been a 'solo' coder, not out of choice, but being self taught never 'fitted-in', didn't adhere to the coding 'standards'.

Git enables me to display my coding, and more importantly learn the standards that are required.

Whilst I can code, I am useless at graphic/artistic design, I teamed up with a superb design company - Storm Uk - to solve that problem;

Hopefully I can find designers to work with on Git!

Current projects;
- ðŸ”­ Orion Dice Decide ... in progress
- ðŸ”­ LetComm ... first stages
