### Greetings ðŸ‘‹

I've been coding for 40 years, can't remember how many languages I've forgotton.

The one thing I have learnt, is that whilst I can make stuff work, I am *useless* at making stuff look good.

It's working with *creative, artistic* people that makes the difference, some examples;

www.trackpro.co.uk (2007 - Insurance Claim tracking system)
www.thersp.com (2002 - Now Viviene Clore - Artisite Contnet Management System)
www.sharonleeltd.co.uk (2001 - Cap design  system)

My skills are all back end; .NET, SQLServer etc, not getting involved with the html, ccss, javascipt.

I decided to recity that, the results, so far, you can see at my *apprentice* javascript piece; Orion Dice Decide.
