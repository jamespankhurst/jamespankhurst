### I don't have many regrets in life, but... 

.. I wished I had explored Git earlier.

Been coding for years and had been meaning to look into it.

Finally got un-lazy in September 2021.   

What a fantastic resource. 

My coding background, from the 80's, was mainly backend, database systems. 

Before the internet, we didn't really pay a lot of attention to how things looked....the internet was created and design became paramount. 

I realised that whilst I could make stuff work, I was *useless* at making stuff look good. 

It was when I hooked up with *Storm Design* in early 2000's, that I realised that it's working with *creative, artistic* people that makes the difference.

Some examples;

I developed an online database application Claimtrack.co.uk, classic ASP, for the insurance repair/refurbishment industry.

I then re-coded for .NET and Claimtrack became;

This was a great tool for landlords, but was of no use to tenants.

In the current and future generations, for many, home ownership hss become a *hope*, rather than an *expectation*.

Yet the landlords and property management companies hold all the cards.

So I've decided to re-write my code once again, this time for the tenant...

Recent events gave me time to study Javascript. 

Obviously I have been using js for years, but as a back end coder, really just passed data for the designers.

Harking back to my Commodore 64 coding days, I decided to make a game.
