### Hallo 👋

I've always been a 'solo' coder, not out of choice, but being self taught never 'fitted-in', didn't adhere to the coding 'standards'.

Git enables me to display my coding, and more importantly learn the standards that are required.

Whilst I can code, I am useless at graphic/artistic design.

Hopefully I can find designers to work with on Git!

Current projects;
- 🔭 Orion Dice Decide ... in progress
- 🔭 LetComm ... first stages
